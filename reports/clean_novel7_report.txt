that would count with you, but I am quite convinced that this brain

was Li Chang Yen's."

  Chapter: CHAPTER 3 (Chapter 3)
  Position in Chapter: 25.86%
  Scene Sentence: "What exactly he hopes to get out of it all I cannot pretend to say

for certain," went on Mr. Ingles; "but I assume his disease is one

that has attacked great brains from the time of Akbar and Alexander to

Napoleon--a lust for power and personal supremacy.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 3 (Chapter 3)
  Position in Chapter: 26.24%
  Scene Sentence: Up to modern times

armed force was necessary for conquest, but in this century of unrest

a man like Li Chang Yen can use other means.

character, and honesty, and brain power.

  Scene Sentence: One

was poisoned; one died of cholera, an isolated case--not part of an

epidemic; and one was found dead in his bed.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 3 (Chapter 3)
  Position in Chapter: 36.88%
  Scene Sentence: The cause of the last

death was never determined, but I was told by a doctor who saw the

corpse that it was burnt and shrivelled as though a wave of electrical

energy of incredible power had passed through it."

Mr. Ingles was a man mounted on his hobby horse, and evidently he, too,
