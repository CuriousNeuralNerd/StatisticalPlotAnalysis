                            THE WHOLE TRUTH





A slight gesture from Poirot enjoined me to stay behind the rest.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 25 (Chapter 25)
  Position in Chapter: 2.67%
  Scene Sentence: For a moment I was inclined to think that the scene

I had just witnessed was a gigantic piece of bombast—that he had been

what he called “playing the comedy” with a view to making himself

interesting and important.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 25 (Chapter 25)
  Position in Chapter: 3.33%
  Scene Sentence: But, in spite of myself, I was forced to

believe in an underlying reality.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 25 (Chapter 25)
  Position in Chapter: 4.67%
  Scene Sentence: But I still believed him to be

on entirely the wrong tack.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 25 (Chapter 25)
  Position in Chapter: 16.00%
  Scene Sentence: Merci, mon ami_, but I am not

sufficiently heroic for that.”

  Chapter: CHAPTER 25 (Chapter 25)
  Position in Chapter: 16.67%
  Scene Sentence: “Then I fail to understand you.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 25 (Chapter 25)
  Position in Chapter: 17.33%
  Scene Sentence: Surely you are running the risk of

letting the murderer escape by thus putting him on his guard?”

  Chapter: CHAPTER 25 (Chapter 25)
  Position in Chapter: 25.33%
  Scene Sentence: Now, to begin with, there were two facts

and one little discrepancy in time which especially attracted my

attention.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 25 (Chapter 25)
  Position in Chapter: 26.67%
  Scene Sentence: If Ralph Paton were

indeed the murderer, the telephone call became meaningless and absurd.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 25 (Chapter 25)
  Position in Chapter: 27.33%
  Scene Sentence: Therefore, I said to myself, Ralph Paton is not the murderer.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 25 (Chapter 25)
  Position in Chapter: 32.00%
  Scene Sentence: Which was—that the murder was

discovered that night instead of—in all probability—the following

morning.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 25 (Chapter 25)
  Position in Chapter: 34.00%
  Scene Sentence: Yes.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 25 (Chapter 25)
  Position in Chapter: 38.00%
  Scene Sentence: The only idea I

could get hold of was that the murderer, knowing the crime was to be

discovered at a certain time, could make sure of being present when the

door was broken in—or at any rate immediately afterwards.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 25 (Chapter 25)
  Position in Chapter: 40.00%
  Scene Sentence: I, on the contrary, have

always regarded it as of supreme importance.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 25 (Chapter 25)
  Position in Chapter: 40.67%
  Scene Sentence: “In your manuscript you have drawn a neat little plan of the study.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 25 (Chapter 25)
  Position in Chapter: 44.67%
  Scene Sentence: But I soon abandoned that supposition,

for though the chair was a grandfather with a high back, it obscured

very little of the window—only the part between the sash and the

ground.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 25 (Chapter 25)
  Position in Chapter: 47.33%
  Scene Sentence: Something placed there by the murderer?

  Chapter: CHAPTER 25 (Chapter 25)
  Position in Chapter: 48.67%
  Scene Sentence: But I knew certain very

interesting facts about it.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 25 (Chapter 25)
  Position in Chapter: 49.33%
  Scene Sentence: For instance, it was something that the

murderer had not been able to take away with him at the time that he

committed the crime.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 25 (Chapter 25)
  Position in Chapter: 50.67%
  Scene Sentence: And

so—the telephone message, and the opportunity for the murderer to be on

the spot when the body was discovered.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 25 (Chapter 25)
  Position in Chapter: 54.00%
  Scene Sentence: Parker, then, was cleared (of the murder, that is.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 25 (Chapter 25)
  Position in Chapter: 55.33%
  Scene Sentence: Raymond and Blunt, however, remained under suspicion since, if the

crime had been discovered in the early hours of the morning, it was

quite possible that they might have arrived on the scene too late to

prevent the object on the round table being discovered.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 25 (Chapter 25)
  Position in Chapter: 56.67%
  Scene Sentence: You heard my arguments to-night in reference

to the scrap of conversation overheard?

  Chapter: CHAPTER 25 (Chapter 25)
  Position in Chapter: 58.67%
  Scene Sentence: They all agreed with my theory—but one vital fact

seems to have escaped them.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 25 (Chapter 25)
  Position in Chapter: 61.33%
  Scene Sentence: But no

dictaphone has been found amongst his effects.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 25 (Chapter 25)
  Position in Chapter: 63.33%
  Scene Sentence: The attention of every

one was, of course, focused on the murdered man.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 25 (Chapter 25)
  Position in Chapter: 65.33%
  Scene Sentence: There must have been a receptacle of some kind capable of

holding it.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 25 (Chapter 25)
  Position in Chapter: 66.67%
  Scene Sentence: The figure of the murderer is taking

shape.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 25 (Chapter 25)
  Position in Chapter: 67.33%
  Scene Sentence: A person who was on the scene straightway, but who might not

have been if the crime had been discovered the following morning.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 25 (Chapter 25)
  Position in Chapter: 71.33%
  Scene Sentence: But

consider this useful invention for a little minute.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 25 (Chapter 25)
  Position in Chapter: 76.67%
  Scene Sentence: “And the murderer switched it on.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 25 (Chapter 25)
  Position in Chapter: 79.33%
  Scene Sentence: But in that case we must add two

qualifications to our imaginary portrait of the murderer.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 25 (Chapter 25)
  Position in Chapter: 82.67%
  Scene Sentence: He had been at Fernly

that night, and might have climbed into the study and found his uncle

dead there.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 25 (Chapter 25)
  Position in Chapter: 88.67%
  Scene Sentence: According to the police theory, Ralph was wearing another pair

of the same kind, and I found out that it was true that he had two

pairs.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 25 (Chapter 25)
  Position in Chapter: 89.33%
  Scene Sentence: Now for my theory to be proved correct it was necessary for the

murderer to have worn Ralph’s shoes that evening—in which case Ralph

must have been wearing yet a _third_ pair of footwear of some kind.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 25 (Chapter 25)
  Position in Chapter: 92.67%
  Scene Sentence: The first question I asked him when he came to

my house yesterday morning was what he was wearing on his feet on the

fatal night.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 25 (Chapter 25)
  Position in Chapter: 94.00%
  Scene Sentence: “So we get a step further in our description of the murderer—a person

who had the opportunity to take these shoes of Ralph Paton’s from the

Three Boars that day.”

  Chapter: CHAPTER 25 (Chapter 25)
  Position in Chapter: 95.33%
  Scene Sentence: The murderer must have been a person who

had the opportunity to purloin that dagger from the silver table.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 25 (Chapter 25)
  Position in Chapter: 96.00%
  Scene Sentence: You

might argue that any one in the house might have done so, but I will

recall to you that Miss Ackroyd was very positive that the dagger was

not there when she examined the silver table.”

  Position in Chapter: 0.00%
  Scene Sentence: CHAPTER 26



                       AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH





There was a dead silence for a minute and a half.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 26 (Chapter 26)
  Position in Chapter: 1.32%
  Scene Sentence: Then I laughed.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 26 (Chapter 26)
  Position in Chapter: 10.53%
  Scene Sentence: “But yes.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 26 (Chapter 26)
  Position in Chapter: 19.74%
  Scene Sentence: Would there be time in that ten minutes for you to run round the

outside of the house, change your shoes, climb in through the window,

kill Ackroyd, and get to the gate by nine o’clock?

  Chapter: CHAPTER 26 (Chapter 26)
  Position in Chapter: 21.05%
  Scene Sentence: I decided against

that theory since in all probability a man as nervous as Ackroyd was

that night would hear you climbing in, and then there would have been

a struggle.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 26 (Chapter 26)
  Position in Chapter: 22.37%
  Scene Sentence: But supposing that you killed Ackroyd _before_ you left—as

you were standing beside his chair?

  Chapter: CHAPTER 26 (Chapter 26)
  Position in Chapter: 38.16%
  Scene Sentence: It has not done

you much good.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 26 (Chapter 26)
  Position in Chapter: 39.47%
  Scene Sentence: You lost most of it in speculation—then you put the

screw on too hard, and Mrs. Ferrars took a way out that you had not

expected.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 26 (Chapter 26)
  Position in Chapter: 48.68%
  Scene Sentence: It was a very clever touch, that.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 26 (Chapter 26)
  Position in Chapter: 52.63%
  Scene Sentence: I

had no thought of Miss Russell in my mind at that time.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 26 (Chapter 26)

“It was a clever idea,” said Poirot. “

  Chapter: CHAPTER 26 (Chapter 26)
  Position in Chapter: 80.26%
  Scene Sentence: But, for the sake of your good sister, I am willing to

give you the chance of another way out.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 26 (Chapter 26)
  Position in Chapter: 89.47%
  Scene Sentence: “Now that you remind me of the fact, it is true that there is one thing

more.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 26 (Chapter 26)
  Position in Chapter: 93.42%
  Scene Sentence: “My dear Poirot,” I said, smiling a little, “whatever else I may be, I

am not a fool.”

  Chapter: CHAPTER 26 (Chapter 26)

  Scene Sentence: Thank

you for a most interesting and instructive evening.”

  Chapter: CHAPTER 27 (Chapter 27)

the history of one of Poirot’s failures!

  Chapter: CHAPTER 27 (Chapter 27)
  Position in Chapter: 8.06%

Ralph Paton and Mrs. Ferrars with their heads together.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 27 (Chapter 27)
  Position in Chapter: 11.29%
  Scene Sentence: Poor old Ackroyd.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 27 (Chapter 27)
  Position in Chapter: 12.90%
  Scene Sentence: I’m always glad that I gave him a chance.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 27 (Chapter 27)
  Position in Chapter: 16.13%
  Scene Sentence: Or let me be honest—didn’t

I subconsciously realize that with a pig-headed chap like him, it was

my best chance of getting him _not_ to read it?

  Chapter: CHAPTER 27 (Chapter 27)
  Position in Chapter: 24.19%
  Scene Sentence: I’d brought up a very handy little

weapon of my own, but when I saw the dagger lying in the silver table,

it occurred to me at once how much better it would be to use a weapon

that couldn’t be traced to me.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 27 (Chapter 27)
  Position in Chapter: 25.81%
  Scene Sentence: I suppose I must have meant to murder him all along.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 27 (Chapter 27)
  Position in Chapter: 27.42%
  Scene Sentence: As soon as I heard

of Mrs. Ferrars’s death, I felt convinced that she would have told him

everything before she died.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 27 (Chapter 27)
  Position in Chapter: 32.26%
  Scene Sentence: If the trouble were after all

only something to do with Ralph—well, no harm would have been done.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 27 (Chapter 27)
  Position in Chapter: 35.48%
  Scene Sentence: Something had

gone a little wrong with it, and I persuaded him to let me have a go at

it, instead of sending it back.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 27 (Chapter 27)
  Position in Chapter: 38.71%
  Scene Sentence: I am rather pleased with myself as a writer.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 27 (Chapter 27)
  Position in Chapter: 45.16%
  Scene Sentence: All true, you see.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 27 (Chapter 27)
  Position in Chapter: 50.00%
  Scene Sentence: When I looked round the room from the door, I was quite satisfied.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 27 (Chapter 27)
  Position in Chapter: 53.23%
  Scene Sentence: The dictaphone was on the table by the

window, timed to go off at nine-thirty (the mechanism of that little

device was rather clever—based on the principle of an alarm clock), and

the arm-chair was pulled out so as to hide it from the door.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 27 (Chapter 27)
  Position in Chapter: 56.45%
  Scene Sentence: I have faithfully recorded that fact.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 27 (Chapter 27)

seen her uncle alive at a quarter to ten.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 27 (Chapter 27)

  Chapter: CHAPTER 27 (Chapter 27)

out....



I can trust him.

  Scene Sentence: She is fond of me, and then, too, she

is proud.... My death will be a grief to her, but grief passes....



When I have finished writing, I shall enclose this whole manuscript in

an envelope and address it to Poirot.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 27 (Chapter 27)
  Position in Chapter: 88.71%
  Scene Sentence: There would be a kind of poetic

justice.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 27 (Chapter 27)

  Scene Sentence: Not that I take any responsibility for Mrs. Ferrars’s death.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 27 (Chapter 27)

her.
