chair, but he remained seated, although a remarkably well acted

expression of astonishment rose on his face.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 6. (Chapter 6)
  Position in Chapter: 70.00%
  Scene Sentence: But, seeing it was Mr. Inglethorp of the

Hall, I thought there was no harm in it.

poisoning a dog?”

  Scene Sentence: Inglethorp replied with perfect calmness:



“No, I did not.

you decline to say where you were at the time that Mr. Mace positively

recognized you as entering the shop to purchase strychnine?”

  Chapter: CHAPTER 6. (Chapter 6)
  Position in Chapter: 95.00%
  Scene Sentence: I meant to do so,

but I was told that a friend was at the hall door, so I laid down the

coffee on the hall table.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 6. (Chapter 6)
  Position in Chapter: 95.59%
  Scene Sentence: This statement might, or might not, be true, but it did not seem to me

to improve matters much for Inglethorp.

  Chapter: CHAPTER 6. (Chapter 6)

  Chapter: CHAPTER 7. (Chapter 7)
  Position in Chapter: 12.69%
  Scene Sentence: I must say I was surprised the jury didn’t bring

it in Wilful Murder against him right off.

that it has defeated its own ends.”
